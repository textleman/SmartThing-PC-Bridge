Installation Instructions for the TP-Link Bridge for SmartThings

These instructions are for the installation of the TP-Link devices into the SmartThings platform.  There are four aspects of this installation:

a.	The Windows 10 PC based node.js utility which provides the framework.
b.	Copy these files to the server PC.
c.	The node.js applet "TP-LinkServer.js", the interface between SmartThings and the TP-Link devices.
d.	The device handlers (one for each device type you use) that implement the Bridge control on your smart phone.

INSTALLATION FILES

•	“TP-Link Bridge Install.txt” - these installation instructions.
•	“TP-LinkBridge.js” – the single node.js server script.
•	“TP-LinkBridge.bat” – a MS Windows server start file.
•	“TP-LinkBridge.grooy” – SmartThings Device Handler for bridge to both the PC and the TP-linkServer.js applet.
•	“SoloBridge.grooy” – SmartThings Device Handler for the bridge only.
•	“cmdPrompt.bat” - windows command prompt.

PRE-REQUISITES

- 	Windows machine that stays turned on, logged in, and connected to your local network all the time. This will be your gateway PC.
- 	Static IP address for your gateway PC. Assign through your router.
- 	The common recommendation is to disable automatic updates on the gateway PC so it does not auto-restart and kill your node.js session. Do this at your own risk.

NODE.JS UTILITY INSTALLATION

Install this utility from this link directly.  Ensure that you get the "msi" installer package, not just the "exe" binary.

COPY FILES TO THE SERVER PC

1.	Copy the files to a convenient location on your server PC.  My install was at "C:\\TPLink" which greatly shortened the path in the batch files.

2.	Open the batch file "TP-LinkBridge.bat" and edit to change the directory to where the files were copied.

3.	Test the server by starting the batch file “TP-LinkBridge.bat”.  This should start the server in a separate window on your display.

ENABLE DEVICE ON SMARTTHINGS

1.	Log in to SmartThings IDE.  (You may have to create an acccount.  There are two log-ins required at the server.  The IDE log-in and the "My Locations" login.  Both are required, using the same username and password.)

2.	Go to "My Device Handler" and select "+ Create New Device Handler".

3.	Select the tab "From Code".

4.	Open the GROOVY file associated with your device and copy the contents.

5.	Past the contents into the the IDE window.  Select "Create" at the bottom.

7.	On the next page that opens, click “Publish”, then “For Me” near the top-right of the page. 

8.	Go to "My Devices" in IDE, click on New Device in the top right corner (you will repeat this step for each of the outlets you have)
  o	Name - enter a name for the product *i.e., “TP-Link Bridge", "Bridge")
  o	Label - enter a label, this is what will show in the SmartThings app, (i.e., “Bridge”, "zBridge").
  o	Device Network Id - enter a unique ID (i.e., “Bridge”).
  o	Type - select the appropriate groovy file from the drop down list (should be near the bottom of the list).
  o	Version - Published
  o	Location and Hub - select for your setup
  o	Group - leave blank for now, you can assign to a room later through the app
  o	 Click Create

9.	Open SmartThings on your smart phone and select your device.  Go to the Settings page.
		Bridge IP.  Enter the IP Address of the server PC.

10.	Test the functions of your device.

KEEPING YOUR BRIDGE PC AND APPLICATIONS RUNNING, EVEN AFTER RESTARTS.

Several users have had problems keeping the server application running.  This is typically due to
a.	The PC restarting after updates,
b.	Power failures, and
c.	Resets of the local router.

Prerequisites

a.	Windows 10 PC on WiFi and Windows , and
b.	a Router that allows you to reserve IP addresses (i.e., set up static IP)

Steps

1.	On your PC.  You have already modified the “TP-LinkServer.bat” for your path.  Use this file below.
	a.	Go to Windows Scheduler (Control Panel -> System and Security -> Administrative Tools -> Task Scheduler)
	b.	Add a task to schedule "TP-LinkServer.bat" to start every time you log on.
	c.	Set Windows to automatically Log you in.  See site :
		https://www.cnet.com/how-to/automatically-log-in-to-your-windows-10-pc1)
	d.	Go to the BIOS power setting and set PC to NEVER go into standby.

2.	ON your WiFi Router.
	a.	Reserve an IP address for your server PC and your controlled TP-Link devices.
	b.	Restart your router. Wait for the reboot to complete.

3.	Go to the smart phone SmartThings App and update your TP-Link device setting to the new IP addresses (for the devices and server).

4.	Reboot your PC. It should automatically run the node app. 

5.	Test your device(s).

6.	(You can now disconnect /power off monitor, mouse, and keyboard.)
